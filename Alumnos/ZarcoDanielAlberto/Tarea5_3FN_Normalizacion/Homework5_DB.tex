\paragraph{Conclusion\\\\}
These tables are in third normal form from normalization's rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1NF) All elements are atomic and don't have multi-value's attributes, and we don't have repeated row in the tables.
\item 2NF) We don't have partial relations of form x -> y, y -> z.
\item 3NF) Tables don't have transition relations, and tables are in second normal form.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Conclusion\\\\}
These tables are in third normal form from normalization's rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1NF) All elements are atomic and don't have multi-value's attributes, and we don't have repeated row in the tables.
\item 2NF) We don't have partial relations of form x -> y, y -> z.
\item 3NF) Tables don't have transition relations, and tables are in second normal form. We follow the implications of tables.
